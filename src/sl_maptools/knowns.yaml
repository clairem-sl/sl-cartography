  metadata:
    name_source: Claire Morgenthau & SLGI
    name_lore: >-
      SLGI originally named this region just "1700", but this potentially causes problems because the name looks like
      an integer and JavaScript will too-happily coerce that to integer.
      Claire recognized that the names of the regions in the areas are well-known pirate strongholds, either IRL or in
      fictional stories.
      These considerations, plus the existence of a centrally-positioned "Pirates Harbor" region, led her to name
      the regions "Pirates1700" instead of just "1700"
